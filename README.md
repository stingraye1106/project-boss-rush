## Dev Notes

I've mostly focused on implementing the gameplay as it's the most important component when it comes to developing the game. While working on this technical exam, I've learned a lot along the way and I'm happy and proud that I managed to implement finite state machines myself when handling character animations and game states. It's one of the things I would like to learn and understand more, so I am grateful to have the opportunity to do a practical application of FSM and gain practical experience on implementing one.

For the game itself, I'd like to showcase how the dodge/sprint mechanic and the pick-ups can add to the strategy of the player, giving more reason to maneuver around or dodge at the right timing or direction.â€‹

## How to Play

Try to beat the boss before the boss beats you! Use your available skills at your disposal, dodge the boss attacks, and make use of the periodically-spawning pickups to gain an advantage!

### Available pick-ups:

- Attack buff (red cube) - temporarily boosts your attacks
- Defense buff (blue cube) - temporarily reduces damage taken
- Heal buff (green cube) - heals by a certain amount

### Controls:

- WASD / Arrow Keys to move
- Left Shift to sprint/dodge
- Left Click to use basic attack
- 1/2/3 to cast Ability 1/2/3

### Notes:

- No VFX/sounds implemented for now since I focused more on the gameplay mechanics
- Ability 3 (for both player and enemy) is a 2-hit ability (slash + shockwave) but is not obvious at the moment due to the lack of visual indicators (no vfx)
